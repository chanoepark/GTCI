Dutch National Flag Problem

Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. 
You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; 
and since our input array also consists of three different numbers 
that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]

Example 2:
Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]
